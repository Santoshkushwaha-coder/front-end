        <p>
            Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Python's design 
            philosophy emphasizes code readability with its 
            notable use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object
            -oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
            Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
             including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. 
             Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

            Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming
             language, and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[32] Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and 
             introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference
              counting and was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.[33] Python 3.0 was released in 2008 and was
               a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible and much Python 2 code does
                not run unmodified on Python 3.

        <p>
            Python was conceived in the late 1980s[39] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI)
             in the Netherlands as a successor to ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[40] capable 
             of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[10] Its implementation began in 
             December 1989.[41] Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, 
             until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's
              Benevolent Dictator For Life, a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term 
              commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.[42] He now shares his leadership as a member of a 
              five-person steering council.[43][44][45] In January 2019, active Python core developers elected Brett 
              Cannon, Nick Coghlan, Barry Warsaw, Carol Willing and Van Rossum to a five-member "Steering Council" to 
              lead the project.[46] Guido van Rossum has since then withdrawn his nomination for the 2020 Steering council.
